However, because we have so few data points, the validation set would end up being very small (e.g. about 100 examples). A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot depending on which data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a high variance with regard to the validation split. This would prevent us from reliably evaluating our model.\n",

The validation score for the model used would then be the average of the K validation scores obtained.\n",
